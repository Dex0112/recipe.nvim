Got the idea from a youtube video (https://youtu.be/cuuXvVfORfk?si=wVbHBwylADoON9MN). 
Basically when you start recipe.nvim it will bring up a buffer where you will make a todo list for the next 10 minutes. 
You will continue to make a todo list every 10 minutes until disabled. 
The goal of this project is to make it easier to start programming for when you want to program but find it difficult to make yourself start. 
Much like a recipe for cooking the goal is to split your coding into digestible chunks and to do that regularly to keep you in it.
